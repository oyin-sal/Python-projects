Hi,
welcome to Oyinkansola Salisu's Data Science portfolio. 

In this depository, you can find examples of my work using Python libraries such as  Pandas, Numpy, Skicit learn, Keras, etc.
Including data exploration and visualisations, preprocessing, modelling, cross-validation and optimization techniques.

1. Clothing Size prediction model: Exploring machine learning algorithms (Random forest, regression, gradient boosting), Generative AI for synthetic data generation (Autoencoders, GMM), KNN for missing data imputation

2. Time series forecasting with Neural Networks: Architectures - Recurrent, Concurrent and LSTM networks

3. K-means clustering - data visualisation, preprocessing and unsupervised learning approach.
