        "In conclusion, This project set out to examine the problem of sales forecasting in the retail industry, specifically for a Walmart grocery store. Using historical sales data from a particular store (store 16), we trained and evaluated different neural networks such as the Recurrent Neural network, Convolutional Neural network, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network and RNN-LSTM model to predict future sales.\n",
        "Further, we employed several optimisation techniques to improve the performance of the models such as random search and ensemble methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we found that the RNN-optimised model outperformed all other models with a root mean square value of 0.014 on the validation set. This model then scored 0.023 on the test set, which shows that it can generalise accurately.\n",
        "This shows that our model can account for 99.77% of the variance in the test data, making it an accurate tool for predicting future sales."

        "It is worth noting that the LSTM model could not be optimisation using random search due to a computing environment limitation. The kernel kept dying, which made it difficult to fine-tune the model efficiently. Other optimisation methods like grid search were also affected by this issue. As a result, the LSTM model's performance may not represent its true capabilities because it was not optimised to its maximum potential."

        "The Walmart management team of store 16 should seriously consider implimenting this forecasting model to project future customer sales, which can aid in making production and inventory stocking decisions more efficient.  Furthermore, this model could assist in the reduction of disposal costs, waste and improve staffing management.\n",
        "\n",
        "We suggest that the gloabl executive team expand the use of this model to all stores within Walmart's grocery store chain. We anticipate significant cost savings as a result of implementing this model across the board."
